  abstract = {A successful verification of a method for numerical reconstruction of axially symmetric refractive index distribution is reported. Directions of rays emerging from a test object are used as input data for reconstruction. They are obtained by numerically calculating the spatial frequency of the fringes in an interferogram. It is also shown that the same data can be obtained directly by counting moir\'{e} fringes arising from two slightly displaced interferograms. An acrylic resin immersed in liquid is used as a test object. The reconstruction is carried out with errors of a few percent.},

shape and color of large fragile objects under non-laboratory conditions.
Our system employs laser triangulation rangefinders, laser
time-of-flight rangefinders, digital still cameras, and a suite of software
for acquiring, aligning, merging, and viewing scanned data.
As a demonstration of this system, we digitized 10 statues by
Michelangelo, including the well-known figure of David, two building
interiors, and all 1,163 extant fragments of the Forma Urbis
Romae, a giant marble map of ancient Rome. Our largest single
dataset is of the David - 2 billion polygons and 7,000 color images.
In this paper,we discuss the challenges we faced in building this
system, the solutions we employed, and the lessons we learned. We
focus in particular on the unusual design of our laser triangulation
scanner and on the algorithms and software we developed for handling
very large scanned models."
